# poemTopicViz&Model
project for the course 'text mining the great unread' in Aarhus university
In this project, the texts used are Chinese ancient poems in Tang dynasty, over 40000 poems. Generally, the gist and emotion of literary works interpreted by readers are subjective, to some extent. Just as a famous saying goes, there are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people's eyes. However, is it possible to explore out the deadly right answer for Hamlets using some quantitative methods, for example topic models? This is one of the interesting points to explore in this project.

This report focuses on two major objectives. One of the objectives is using the topic model (LDA) to find and define the topics of Chinese ancient poems. Another objective is exploring some methods of visualization, for example pyLDAvis and wordcloud, to make the topics or information extracted from great texts more readable and valuable.
